# My Notes app

## Comments: 
 - This app is challenge made by myself for myself, to see how an app with a single activty, but also with changes on views, would turn out.
 - It ended up pretty cool, easier to code in, but a little bit disorganized. All and all, I kinda liked it.
 - Please, consider checking it out and giving ideas or reporting bugs!
 
## Description of the app:
 - The idea of the app is pretty simple, the user has a Master Book. Inside this Master book, the user can create regular books, and notes. Books can store notes, and notes can store general text information.
 - Notes and books can be locked, where the user will set a numeric password to access or delete said note or book. (WARNING! - The user CANNOT recover the password once it's set. Try not to forget it! ;D)
 
## How the app looks:

 - Fairly simple and straight foward!
